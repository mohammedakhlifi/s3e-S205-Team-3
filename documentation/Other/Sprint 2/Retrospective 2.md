# SMART Retrospective

## **S**pecific:
- **What Went Well**: 
  - Team communication was efficient. Each member had a clear task, which contributed to smooth project progress.
  - Backend and frontend were successfully connected.
  - Interview data was well-organized into charts.

- **What Didn’t Go Well**: 
  - The wireframes lacked consistency in design (some had color, others didn't), which affected the UI planning.
  - The ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) contained 7 tables with PK and FK connections but needed further refinement.
  - The backlog was only organized by priority and lacked clear labels, making it harder to navigate and manage.

## **M**easurable:
- **Improvement Goal**: 
  - Standardize wireframe designs with consistent color schemes.
  - Organize the backlog with clear labels for better clarity and task management.

- **Tracking**:
  - Conduct weekly checks to ensure all wireframes have consistent designs by the next sprint.
  - Track backlog improvements by monitoring task clarity and completion rates using a more detailed labeling system.

## **A**ttainable:
- **Plan**:
  - Collaborate with a designer to create a unified color scheme and apply it across all wireframes.
  - Work with the project manager to enhance backlog labeling with tags like “UI,” “Backend,” and “Testing.”

- **Resources**:
  - Use design tools (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD) for wireframes.
  - Utilize project management software (e.g., Jira, Trello) to implement the labeling system in the backlog.

## **R**elevant:
- **Impact**:
  - A consistent design will improve user experience and reduce confusion in UI planning.
  - A well-labeled backlog will streamline task prioritization and workflow efficiency.
  - A refined ERD will help prevent data relationship issues in future project phases.

## **T**ime-Bound:
- **Wireframes**: Complete consistent design with color schemes within the next 2 sprints.
- **ERD**: Simplify and refine ERD connections within the next 5 working days.
- **Backlog**: Implement detailed labeling by the end of the current week.
